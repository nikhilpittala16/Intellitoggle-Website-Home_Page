## Notes & Tradeoffs

- **Image Handling:** Images are currently stored in the repository. With more time, I would compress them and use a cloud service (e.g., AWS blob, Firebase, Cloudinary) to keep the repo lightweight.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Lazy loading is implemented. Further improvements could include serving images in WebP/AVIF formats and leveraging a CDN for faster delivery.
- **UI & Features:** Some responsiveness adjustments and minor features were simplified for speed of development.
- Accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation) not fully implemented, which could limit usability for some users, so with more time, I would make it more accessible and SEO optimised.
- The layout is responsive for desktop and mobile, but there are a few breakpoints where the design struggles to adapt properly. With more time, I would be able to fix that and improve the user experience
